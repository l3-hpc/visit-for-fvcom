# visit-for-fvcom
VisIt scripts for plotting data from FVCOM output files

Before running, do: 

cp setpaths.py.template setpaths.py

Then set the paths


Also before creating a movie with the outputs, do:

cp makemovie.csh.template makemovie.csh

Then copy to the directory where the images are (sorry, will change later), set the FFMEG parameters, and do:

source makemovie.csh


To open GUI from command line:

visit -cli -s scriptname.py

To run without window:

visit -cli -nowin -s scriptname.py

on my Mac:

/full/path/to/visit -cli -nowin -s /path/to/visit-for-fvcom/scriptname.py

Or open visit or python and (Capital S is correct):

Source("scriptname.py")

Useful commands:

dir()

help()

ClearCache

Sometimes during extended VisIt runs, you might want to periodically clear the compute engineâ€™s network cache to reduce the amount of memory being used by the compute engine

SetPipelineCachingMode

SetPipelineCachingMode(0) # Disable caching

Disabling caching is still grinding script to a halt on the Mac

a = GetAnnotationAttributes()

print(a)
